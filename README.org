# Unnecessarily-3D clock

A [[re-frame][https://github.com/day8/re-frame]] application made to mess around
with Doug Hamilton's [[https://github.com/DougHamil/threeagent][threeagent]]. 

Threeagent provides a reagent-based wrapper to [[https://threejs.org/][three.js]].

Live demo [[https://martin.varela.fi/2019/11/01/webgl-react-and-no-javascript/][here]].

### Run application:

```
lein clean
lein dev
```

shadow-cljs will automatically push cljs changes to the browser.

Wait a bit, then browse to [[http://localhost:8280]].
